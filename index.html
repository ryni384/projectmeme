                    <h1>ABOUT</h1>
                        <p>While most coins try to solve complex global problems. We aren't doing that. $RYNI was created because the world of crypto were fed by greed, fud and fomo. 
                             But we are only doing things that truly matters, the meme, fun, and the vibe. Spread the love for short as per say.</p>
                        <p>We’re not here to sell you on a "trillion-token" pipe dream that promise to hit a cent. We chose a realistic supply because we respect the math. 
                            By keeping the supply fixed, every move on the chart actually means something. No delusions, no infinite supply, just a solid asset built on a foundation of real numbers.</p>
                        <p>We aren't just another ticker on a screen, we’re a shift in how things are done. Starting from the trenches of pump.fun and graduating into a permanent market fixture, 
                            our purpose is to prove that a community-led vibe is stronger than any VC-backed project. We’re here to win, to hold, and to build a status that lasts.</p>

                      <h3>Fair Launch</h3>
                         <p>This is a 100% Fair Launch, every single token is available to the public from day one. By ensuring that no one starts with a "free" advantage, we have handed total control to the public, 
                            making this a project of the people, by the people.</p>
                             <h3>Verifiable Scarcity</h3>
                                <p>Value is protected by a permanent, fixed supply of 1 Billion tokens, because 100% of the supply enters the market at launch, there is zero risk of future dilution or "supply shocks." 
                                    What you see is exactly what exists. This transparent cap ensures that as our ecosystem grows, your stake remains mathematically protected against the inflation that plagues traditional projects.</p>
                                <h3>Mathematical Integrity</h3>
                             <p>We trade in reality, not delusions. Unlike projects with trillions of tokens that promise a "dream cent" they can never mathematically reach, our supply is optimized for genuine value. 
                           We’ve rejected the "infinite zero" trap in favor of a supply that allows for sustainable, realistic growth. Here, your investment is backed by hard math and market logic, not impossible fantasies.</p>

                                <p>We ignite on pump.fun with a focus on raw momentum. This is the start of the climb, we'll meme, build the floor, and graduate the bonding curve to migrate liquidity.</p>
                             <h3>PHASE 2 - Meme, Vibe, and HODL</h3>
                                <p>The meme continuation and the never ending vibe, spreading like a virus and turning it into a movement, and hodling is just part of the culture.</p>
                            <h3>PHASE 3 - The Building of Status</h3>
                                <p>We’re eyeing Tier-1 CEX listings and a permanent spot on the global leaderboards. 
                                    The journey peaks with our own ecosystem, adding real utility that turns our token from a viral sensation into a permanent asset that everyone wishes they bought earlier.</p>
